  | Our main motive is to aware the students about the education culture now a days.Basically, many universities are launched in India with a motive
  | just to earn profit inpite with a thought to educate the present generation and provide quality education to them.Such Universities are now categorised under 
  | Blacklisted Universities by government of India.The proper inspection have been launched in India inorder to bug such illegal and profit earning universities and 
  | hence made a strict action upon it.The government of India has also initiated some plan to protect the students from getting admitted into such universities.
  br
  br
  | Hence,we have listed those black listed as well as legal as well as top ranking universities to help students in choosing correct decession for their
  | future.Assessing the quality of education brings to the fore a number of issues. One issue that emerges when assessing any form of quality education is defining 
  | what counts as quality. Another issue involves who the quality is intended for &ndash; the users, audience or stakeholders? A further issue is the form of assessment 
  | used, who conducts the measurement and the assessment, and what the results are used for. Measuring education quality is complex and involves an understanding of
  |  the history of science, the development of information and web technologies, the increasing importance of the knowledge-based economy, the rise of global science,
  |   and the corresponding 
  | increasing imperative field by higher education institutions and governments to find ways of measuring and benchmarking education quality.
  br
  br
  | Institutions may implement schemes or evaluation mechanisms to identify and promote good teaching practices. The institutional environment of higher education 
  | institutions can also lead to enhancement of quality of the teaching in higher education through various means. Higher education is becoming a major driver of 
  | economic competitiveness in an increasingly
  |  knowledge-driven global economy. The imperative for countries to improve employment skills calls for quality teaching within educational institutions.
  br
  br
  | Institutions want to be recognized as providers of good quality higher education. They understand that competing on the basis of research only is not sufficient
  |   to ensure the reputation of the university. As such, they want to find new ways of demonstrating performance. They respond to students demand for valuable teaching: students want to ensure
  |    that their education will lead to jobs and will give them the skills needed in the society of today and tomorrow. Mobility of students and growth of fees
  |     increase the consideration given by students to the quality of the teaching.
  | Assessment is a central element in the overall quality of teaching and learning in higher education. Well-designed assessment sets clear expectations, establishes
  |  a reasonable workload and provides opportunities for students to self-monitor, rehearse, practice and receive feedback. Assessment is an integral component of a 
  |  coherent educational experience.
  br
  br
  | The relationship between assessment practices and the overall quality of teaching and learning is often underestimated, yet assessment requirements and the 
  | clarity of assessment criteria and standards significantly influence the effectiveness of student learning. Carefully designed assessment contributes directly
  |  to the way students approach their study and therefore contributes indirectly, but powerfully, to the quality of their learning.
